## Description
The goal of this project is to use Flask to deploy a small web app of our own choice.
The next goal is to make sure that the small web application meets the requirements.

## What my project is about
For my project, I decided I wanted to create a poll program where a user could log in and give their input on a poll.
Their login information would be saved, and they would be able to answer two separate polls. 

## Pip install instructions
In order to install all of the files necessary for the program,
please run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
By running this line, you should  be able to execute the program with the required files.

## How to run
In a terminal window, please type the following:
```
python app.py
```
Below the command that you enter, you will see in blue hypertext:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
By clicking on it the program will open a webpage for the project. 
Once you are on the webpage, you will simply have to register for an account to be able to see the polls. 
It is then a simple matter of providing an answer for the polls and submitting your answer(s).
